A comparison of NIMBLE run times using Daniel's linear Gaussian model with the correlated parametrization.  

*  nimCompare.Rmd has all of the code needed to compare NIMBLE to the 'SMC' R package, POMP, and LibBi.
*  auxF_build.R and LWF_build.R have code for the different filters
*  pomp_compareCorr.R and smc_compareCorr.R set up the model for the POMP and SMC packages.
